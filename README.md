## Overcoming YouTube Transcript API Limitation:

💡 Approach: Apify Actor + Workflow Integration
 - Transcript Fetching: Successfully integrated Apify Actor to fetch YouTube transcripts.
 - Workflow Automation: Connected the process into an n8n workflow for seamless automation.
 - AI-Powered Summarization: Leveraged LangChain to generate customized video summaries.
 - Relevant Video Discovery: Used an AI agent and SerpAPI to extract related videos from Google Search.
 - Frontend Integration: Set up a webhook to receive URLs from the frontend and return results via n8n.
 
➡️  Next Steps
 - Handle Longer Videos: Currently, the workflow processes videos up to ~20 minutes. Planning to extend this limit.
 - Upgrade Audio Quality: Improve AI-generated audio to sound more human-like.
 - Multiple API Options: Develop multi-API support for authenticated users.
 - Improve uploading time (currently too long)
